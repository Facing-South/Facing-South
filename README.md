I'm a passionate developer and Flight-Simmer from Germany. Although I work professionally with C#, I still enjoy the advantages of other programming languages and the discover of new opportunities and approaches to develop software for all platforms. At the moment I am very busy with JavaScript and associated with it Ajax, Knockout and jQuery in order to get a safe stand with the use of Node.js and the web development. In addition, there are also HTML and CSS, whereby I use Bootstrap as a framework for CSS and find it absolutely great. On the side, I'm developing a bot for the game League of Legends for a friend, which will take over the leveling of his account for him if you understand :wink:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my projects [Nathan's Level-Bot](https://github.com/Facing-South/NathansLevelBot) and [Green-House](https://github.com/Facing-South/GreenHouse)
- 🌱 I’m learning Electron / Javascript, HTML, CSS
