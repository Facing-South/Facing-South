### Hi there, I'm FacingSouth 👋

Hi everyone, my name is FacingSouth and I work as a software developer in Cologne, Germany. In addition to my daily work with C #, Python and JavaScript, I love trying out everything that the world of software development has to offer. One of my biggest hobbies is my virtual airline called Airfox, which I founded together with 3 other flight simulator enthusiasts. I would be very happy to collaborate on my repositories at any time. Visit me on my Discord server if you want to get in touch with me.</br></br> Kind regards,</br> FacingSouth
