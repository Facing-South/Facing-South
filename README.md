### Hi there, I'm HDZ_Galahad 👋

Hi everyone, my name is FacingSouth and I work as a software developer in Cologne, Germany. In addition to my daily work with C #, Python and JavaScript, I love trying out everything that the world of software development has to offer. One of my biggest hobbies is my virtual airline called Airfox, which I founded together with 3 other flight simulator enthusiasts. I would be very happy to collaborate on my repositories at any time.</br></br> Kind regards,</br> FacingSouth

- 🔭 My strongest weapons are C# and Python
- 🌱 I don`t like building GUIs 
- 🧑‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am german, we do not have fun 🤷‍♂️
