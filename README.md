### Hi there, I'm HDZ_Galahad 👋

and I work as a software developer in Cologne, Germany. In addition to my daily work with C #, Python and JavaScript, I love trying out everything that the world of software development has to offer. Next to the virtual airline called Airfox, which I founded together with 3 other flight simulator enthusiastsm I am the founder of the german gaming-community "Haus der Zeitalter (House of Ages)", where we can enjoy our evening together with a cozy game. I would be very happy to collaborate on my repositories at any time.</br></br> Kind regards,</br> HDZ_Galahad
