### Hi there, I'm FacingSouth 👋

I'm a passionate developer and Flight-Simmer from Germany. Although I work professionally with C#, I still enjoy the advantages of other programming languages and the discover of new opportunities and approaches to develop software for all platforms. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my skills with C#, JavaScript and Python 
- 🌱 I don`t like building GUIs 
- 🧑‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects
- :airplane: Visit my virtual airline [Airfox](https://www.airfox-virtual.de)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am german, we do not have fun 🤷‍♂️
- :phone: Contact me here: [Discord](https://discord.gg/C3gfHBJ)
